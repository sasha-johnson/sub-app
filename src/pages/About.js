      <p>
        Subway has long been a brand synonymous with customization. Known for its slogan "Eat Fresh" and the ability to build your own sandwich, Subway has attracted customers who appreciate the freedom to craft their meals exactly how they want.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite this emphasis on personalization, some Subway locations have strayed from offering a fully customizable experience. In some cases, customers find themselves limited to fixed menu items, unable to modify their sandwiches to meet personal preferences or dietary needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This contradiction strikes at the heart of what Subway has stood for over the years: the idea that customers should be in control of what goes into their meals. By not offering full customization at every location, Subway risks diluting its core identity and the unique experience that has set it apart from other fast food chains.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a brand that built its empire on choice and freshness, the inability to customize feels like a departure from what customers have come to expect. It's a reminder that consistency across locations is vital, especially for a company whose brand is rooted in flexibility and personalization.
